# Visual Swift Map/Filter/Reduce demo

I got tired of Map/Filter/Reduce examples that were just SUM() or AVERAGE(), so I decided to try something more visual.

I'm using CoreImage and CIFilter to combine images.  It's not the best Swift (it's a contrived example and I wanted each part to fit on one slide), and it's (I'm sure) not the best useage of CoreImage, but it's hopefully a different way for people to envision how Map/Filter/Reduce (especially Reduce) works.
